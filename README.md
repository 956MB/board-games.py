# board-games

Collection of terminal based board games written in Python. I started this project initially with just the 'connect-four.py' game to practice with Python classes and to possibly apply some machine learning to the game. Now it has turned into mainly a hub for as many different fun board games as I can write. Hopefully I can still learn more about NN/ML and eventually apply them to my different games. Obviously with these being in Python for the most part, the focus is to just to get the games working in the easiest way I know how and to have fun with it.
